## 🧾 Overview

This week focuses on:
- **Generics** for writing flexible, type-safe code
- **Collections** for storing and managing data
- **Streams** for file input/output
- **Exception Handling** for managing errors
- **Regex** for pattern matching
- **JUnit** for writing tests
- **Java 8 Features** like Lambdas and the Stream API

## 📌 Topics This Week

### 1. Java Generics
- Write code that works with any data type
- Use generic classes and methods

### 2. Collections
- Use common data structures:
  - `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`
- Understand `List`, `Set`, and `Map` interfaces

### 3. Java IO Streams
- Read/write files in Java
- Learn `BufferedReader`, `FileReader`, `InputStreamReader`

### 4. Exceptions
- Handle errors in your program
- Use `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and create custom exceptions

### 5. Regex & JUnit
- Use **Regular Expressions (Regex)** to find patterns in text
- Test your code using **JUnit**

### 6. Java 8 Features
- Write short, clear code with **Lambda expressions**
- Process data with the **Stream API**
- Learn **method references** and **default methods**
